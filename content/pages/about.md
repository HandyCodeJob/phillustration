Summary: About Me

Hello, my name is Phillip Hernandez. I am an Illustrator currently working out of Saint Louis, Missouri. I specialize in limited color ilustration and design, with a fun exciting, and clever use of image and type. I consider my work to be along the thematic lines of "distillation" or "condensation". I am able to convery complex and difficult concepts in beautiful and concise ways.

I truly enjoy the process of boiling down complex visual ideas into the most concise visual way. Succinctness and beauty are my virtues, and I will always choose a more elegant design over convoluted imagery or ideas.
